# Cycle
Warning, in this game you must show survival skills. Be prepared to defend yourself, or you will die.

In this game, you will show your defensive skills and reactions to avoid colliding with your opponent, or you will automatically lose. Players must maneuver their characters to avoid colliding with each other while using strategic moves to make the other player collide with their own body or yours.

The game could be very short or very long, it all depends on your skills. It's time to prove who is the best. Welcome to Cycle!
